Extra Credit Error Checking: 2/4

Note: You have a few tests that fail, unfortunately, because you have a bug
that causes division problems to fail if the second number is a fraction less than 1.
It appears that you only introduced that code trying to do the extra credit.
You made the mistake by doing division of two integers, which will always return an
integer, which means that any number that resolves to less than 1 will return 0.
